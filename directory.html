    <td valign="top"><b>Dr. [REDACTED]</b><br>(Codename: "onehappyfellow")</td>
    <td valign="top">
      Head of Memetic Engineering (OCaml Division). Specializes in "calmly weaving" cognitively placid code structures to pacify aggressive info-hazards.
      <br><i><b>Institute Note:</b> Subject's assertion that "programmers are wizards who forgot their magic" is under review for potential memetic leakage (Class-2 Info-Hazard).</i>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Junior Field Agent Goreng</b><br>(Codename: "sudo_goreng")</td>
    <td valign="top">
      Junior Field Agent, seconded from an external partner (Indonesian Sector). Undergoing cross-training in esoteric functional languages (starting with Elixir, OCaml, Clojure) for multi-paradigm containment.
      <br><i><b>Institute Note:</b> Subject's devout faith is being evaluated as a potential cognitive anchor against memetic influence. See Research Log TS-994-G.</i>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Containment Specialist James</b><br>(Codename: "SlimJimmy")</td>
    <td valign="top">
      Advocates for raw data manipulation over abstracted layers, which are designated "memetically leaky". Frequently cites Protocol 418 as a valid response to nonsensical data requests.
      <br><i><b>Institute Note:</b> Subject's simplistic worldview shows unusual resilience to complexity-based info-hazards. Simple, but effective.</i>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Tim Pote</b><br>(POI-TP-01)</td>
    <td valign="top">
      External contractor designated a Person of Interest. Originator of the "Fusebox" framework, a vector for the TS-CLJ-1 anomaly. Promotes "pragmatic" development methodologies that are fundamentally type-unsafe.
      <br><i><b>Institute Note:</b> Subject's public repository is a known source of ontological instability. All works are to be considered memetically hazardous until proven otherwise. Active monitoring is in effect.</i>
